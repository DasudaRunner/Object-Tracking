&emsp;&emsp;*This isan open source Object-Tracking library, The development language is C++, The classic and mainstream object tracking algorithms and related algorithms are reproduced(For example, RANSAC, least squares and so on). Of course, these are optimized by Eigen3 and openMP.*

## Hardware platform:
___
&emsp;&emsp;*CPU: intel i7 6700K*<br>
&emsp;&emsp;*Memory:8G x 2 DDR4*
___
## Performance:
___
**RANSAC**: Linear Fitting, 600 sample point, 500 iteration, Time consuming:*100us *<br>
**Kalman Filter**: Two dimensional coordinate tracking, System state variable is [x,y,dx,dy],prediction+update,Mean time consuming:*8us*

## ä¸€.Camera calibration(If you want to do something good, you mast sharpen it firstly)<br>
___
Use opencv's own calibration tool to calculate the internal parameters of the camera, the chessboard picture has been given, fool-style operation, take a look.
___
### Requirments:<br>
		opencv: >=3.3.0 or >=3.0.0
		python: >=2.7
		python-opencv:
### Quick Start:<br>
#### 1.Connecte Camera, get images containing checkerboard.
		python getChecker.py # press 's' to save image
#### 2.get images list file
		./create_imagelist imagelist.yaml *.jpg
#### 3.Calculate the internal parameters of the camera.
		./calibration -w=7 -h=7 imagelist.yaml
#### 4.Of course, I encapsulated these commands(2,3) into a script file, and you can also run the following command.
		sudo sh calibration_camera.sh
&emsp;&emsp;get out_camera_data.yml , this is a file that contains your camera's internal reference.
#### 5.You can run ./demo, and get corrected images.
		./demo
